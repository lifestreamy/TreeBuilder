# TreeBuilder
This library is useful for easy and fast building of tree structures (including menus)
For any suggestions and comments open new issue

Use jitpack.io to add this library (add code below to build.gradle), see examples folder for usage scenarios


build.gradle:

allprojects {

    repositories
    {
    
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        
    }
    
}


dependencies 
{

    implementation 'com.github.lifestreamy:TreeBuilder:master-SNAPSHOT'
    
}



And read documentation in the code, it provides all the needed info
