# TreeBuilder
This library is useful for easy and fast building of tree structures (including menus) For any suggestions and comments open new issue

I will probably add some documentation though the code appears to me to be straightforward. 

Use jitpack.io to add this library, the main class is pre-populated with code so you can see exactly what you can do with this
